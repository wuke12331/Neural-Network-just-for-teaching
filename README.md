# Neural-Network-just-for-teaching
1. This is a python program for shallow neural networks based on numpy package,  CNN is not supported right now. This program is only supported for CPU.  This program is just     	for teaching not commercial purpose. 
2. Different activation functions including Sigmoid/Softmax/Relu/tanh are supported in the program. 
3. Different optimization method including normal/Adagrad/Momentum/RMSProp/Adam/ are supported in the program.
4. a krkopt.DATA is appended in this repository for testing.
